            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The Activities Board at Columbia distributed over $395,000 for the 2025-26 academic year on Sept. 3, increasing its total allocations for student groups by 18.7 percent compared to last year.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  ABC, the University’s largest governing board, is a group of student representatives responsible for recognizing and funding student groups. Of the 15 categories that ABC designates, the board allocated the most collective funding to cultural groups, totaling $94,492 across 29 groups. Ten cultural groups did not receive any funding.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  ABC allocates funding by taking a club’s previous allocation and any ABC cosponsorships awarded, then subtracting the rollover revenue, which is the remaining revenue in the organization’s accounts.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It impacts a lot of our biggest groups because our biggest revenue generators are also our biggest spenders,” Armando Javier Gimenez , CC ’26, said in an interview with Spectator. “And it’s simply a matter of if one’s rollover revenue that they reported exceeds how much allocation that we would grant.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  ABC has a cosponsorship pool, which can be used for clubs that are unhappy with their allocation and feel it is insufficient for their needs as an organization. Club leaders can petition for funds from the pool once they receive their allocations.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “ABC still has some money left that we can distribute, and we really encourage them to apply to ABC as soon as possible, as even though we have tried to collect more money than the previous year, it’s still very limited,” Gimenez said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  ABC allocated the largest sum to the Columbia Space Initiative, which received $20,950 this year. The allocation is nearly $3,000 more than the second-highest-funded organization—Columbia University Formula Racing—to which ABC allocated $18,000. CSI took the top spot in last year’s allocations as well, receiving $18,705.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  This year, ABC’s smallest allocation was $60, awarded to Columbia University Fashion Society, a preprofessional organization that hosts networking events geared toward students interested in the fashion industry. This is the first time the club will receive funding since the ABC recognized it.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “You can really put on an event without funding,” CUFS president Fiona Mary Alhadeff, BC ’27, said. “But when it comes to an organization itself, the funding is really crucial for the validation of what it means to be a part of something—and that’s stuff as silly as merchandise, apparel, or events that are club-exclusive.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Alhadeff said that extra funding would help cover expenses for guest speakers, including transportation to events.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Without ABC funding, members of the executive board have historically paid out of pocket for materials for events and recruiting—including posters, flyers, and stickers, according to Alhadeff.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I have no expectation for people to do that, but I think, as president, I’m happy to do that because it’s like an investment to the club that will eventually grow,” Alhadeff said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Fifty-nine student groups did not receive funding this year, a slight increase from last year, when 53 did not receive funding.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Other groups that have traditionally received funding from ABC saw their funding cut back, including Columbia Mock Trial, whose funding was cut by $7,268—around a 72 percent decrease.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Columbia Mock Trial’s treasurer, Indigo Guikema, SEAS ’28, told Spectator the cuts will primarily impact the team’s ability to travel to mock trial tournaments around the country. The club, which typically competes in five to six tournaments each academic year, will likely only be able to attend two or three this year.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We’re really in a tough place right now,” Guikema said. “How can we get our teams to their tournaments and actually do our activity if we can’t travel to about half of the places we go without that money?”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  ABC’s allocation also helps the club cover fees for the American Mock Trial Association and other registration fees for tournaments. Columbia’s Mock Trial team has been “historically well-funded,” according to Guikema, making this year’s decrease even more shocking.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As a result, the club is considering “drastic measures” to account for the funding gap, including limiting recruits to as few as one new member. Potentially, the club may also choose to have just one competitive team, rather than its traditional “A” and “B” teams.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Guikema said this would diminish opportunities for less-experienced members to practice, and “really hurt” the team’s competitive success—not just in this academic year, but for years to come.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Guikema is concerned that the club’s reputation may be a casualty of the cuts, including the impact on the success of the club’s annual invitational, which he says depends heavily on its funding and an adequate number of members to staff it.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Not only will our competitive success take a hit, which will decrease our prestige in the AMTA world, but also our invitational might be looked down upon,” said Guikema. He also noted that turning down invitations to attend other universities’ invitationals will also risk the club’s future opportunities to attend these events.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Gimenez said the club received communication from multiple clubs about cuts to their allocation.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Going forward, this is an issue Gimenez is discussing with his current vice president, Alexander Zhao, CC ’27.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We’re having talks of how students can still continually build their allocation from subsequent years, as well as have this balance of rollover revenue and be able to distribute this fairly and evenly,” Gimenez said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Out of the 53 groups that did not receive allocations from ABC last year, 17 received allocations for the 2025-26 academic year, including the Columbia University Computer Security Club, the Association of Latino Professionals for America Columbia Chapter, and the Columbia Super Smash Bros. Club.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  ABC receives its funding at the Funding at Columbia University summit, an annual meeting in which the four undergraduate student councils, including Columbia College Student Council, Engineering Student Council, General Studies Student Council, and Barnard Student Government Association, determine monetary allocations for Bacchanal—the University’s annual music event—and the six governing boards.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In the last two years, the total F@CU pot has been decreasing, Gimenez told Spectator.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The pot to be distributed amongst governing boards last year was around $1,200,000, and then this year, it was around $1 million. So we lost about $200,000, and that’s split among all of the governing boards,” Gimenez said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  To be recognized by ABC, a group must not be “community service, political, religious, athletic, or activist in purpose,” according to the ABC website.
